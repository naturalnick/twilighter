## Details

### Server:

-  Python-based server using Flask framework
-  Accesses Twitter API v2
-  Collect and filter tweet data
-  Creates API endpoints for the client to call

### Client:

-  Made with Javascript, ReactJS and Bootstrap components
-  Features three main pages (Home, Search, and Random) and a "Not Found" page for 404 errors
-  **Search** allows tweet or keyword searching and sends a request with the query to the server API endpoints which returns that data to present as tweets
-  The **Random** button generates a random tweet based on criteria set by the server

## Skills Developed

-  Quickly learned Python from scratch to build the server
-  Making API requests to the Twitter API using authentication, headers, and queries
-  Communicating between server and client via API endpoints
-  Using React-Router library to implement pages for the front-end
-  Bootstrap continues to save me a lot of time with all the different components available
-  Error handling in Python and Javascript
-  The larger the project got the more it forced me to get organized for my own sanity
